# Ways of teaching

### Split the entire teaching process to stages

1. Learn getting to me in a single place
2. Learn chasing me
3. Learn avoiding bullets
4. Learn shooting me
5. Save neural nets between stages, do not start form scratch every time


### Two states - explore and engage

If they don't see me, they will be in exploring state. They will have more fitness the more area they cover exploring
